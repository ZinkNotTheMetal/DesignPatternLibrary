    /// Why? - Protect and manage initialization, creation dependency on switching
    /// Benefits - Places that need the object, do not have to worry about instantiation. Code that needs the object doesn't need to have the instantiation at compile time.
    ///          - Reduces number of if this instantiated do this
    /// Uses? - AutoFac, Employee Repository with different Orms behind it
    /// Why not everywhere? - Have to change factory to add new implementations
    ///                     - have to have the same "base"
    ///                     - IoC might be able to do this for us
    ///                     - Factory cannot be changed out without changing code
    ///                     - Problem might not be complex enough to need a factory
